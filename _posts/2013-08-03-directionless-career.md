I’m failing. Although it might be premature to judge, my signs aren’t good. I am running out of steam. Every so often I meet an alumni from my high school, or go to a careers fair, and I gain an impulse to fill in some job applications or updated my CV, but that rarely lasts more than a few days, usually before I have the chance to even submit a single application. Is it me, or is this a thing that applies to most students? Many of my classmates seem chilled as ever, but they’ve secured internships at investment banks, major tech companies – some even have multiple offers from competing companies.

High school was easy. I knew what I had to do – wake up, turn up to lessons, do the odd exercises, and trust that the teachers and the course will get me through exams. I’m now applying for internships, and have no idea what I want to do. Banks? Horrendous working hours, but unbeatable pay. Software and tech? Free/cheap food, pretty good working hours, competitive pay, but about the same amount of time staring at a panel of LEDs all day. Research? Pretty chilled, but I’d have retired by the time I manage to get a mortgage. Go into another area entirely? Plausible, improbable, intellectually near-impossible, and financially infeasible.

So work-wise, I’m stalled at a crossroads. My internships haven’t been with any global firms, and I’ve no idea where to go next. And apart from the barrage of career pamphlets and conflicting (not to mention biased) advice from everyone, I’ve nothing to go on. My lack of experience certainly isn’t helping.

They say universities open new doors. No they don’t. They light up new doors, so you are overwhelmed with a choice dilemma. Within the investment banking industry alone, there are at least 10 firms I can name off the top of my head which has offices and internship programmes in London. Apart from a different postcode and logo, I can’t tell the difference between them.

I tried applying to a few internships last year. A typical question: ‘What attracts you to this job?’ I don’t know. ‘Why apply for this role?’ I don’t know. ‘What makes you suitable for this role?’ I don’t know.

I’d always thought the system was for me. School (and my parents) always taught me that a career was simple. Get the grades, get a job. Giving credit where they’re due, school has given me the grades need to get a job. But that was never the problem. Getting the grades was a simple problem of putting in the time. However much they stressed how important it was to study hard, (for me at least) it was the least of my worries.

The ‘system’, the way this fabled career path is preached to students, is misleading. There are two kinds of people who stand to benefit – those with good connections, who can afford to backtrack and work in any sector they want, and those who’ve always wanted to work in a particular role since they were a kid, and will always choose the door they really want to go through. I belong to neither.

My school career sold me a myth. A myth that I’d be able to find my passion, pursue it, and get a job enjoying it. I’d been given a map to show me where I can go, a car to take me there, but what I never got taught was how to decide where to go. And deciding where to go is what really counts.
