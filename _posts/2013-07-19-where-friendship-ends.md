This is probably the fifth time I’ve tried to start a blog. And the last. Hopefully.

Why do people write blogs? To share their happiness? To share their sorrow? Or both? Or to feel loved? I post on Facebook for two reasons – to feel loved/liked, or to share something that is worth reading about, that is of actual significance. To be honest, the latter never gets any likes. Is that a reflection of the people in my immediate social circles, that they simply do not care if the Eurozone falls apart or don’t like watching inspirational videos about ending world hunger? Or rather, is it because Facebook fails to be a platform for intelligent discussion?

I look at everyone else on Facebook, and see how many friends they’ve got. 300. 500. 900. Me? Not even enough to stop Facebook reminding me to ‘find friends’. It’s a depressing state of affairs. Not so long ago, I had 300+ friends. But they were merely acquaintances, if they could be considered as such. Then I adopted the practice of an annual cull, to what I’ve got now, around 120.

Many a time, I find myself asking if I really have that few friends. Looking at others in jealousy, how they seem to be perpetually inundated with notifications and conversations. Is it a fault on my part, that I’ve culled so many ‘friends’, if they could be considered as such. I ask my actual friends, and they always stress the distinction between Facebook and real life friends. Yet they feel compelled to entertain those Facebook friends, those that they always claim to be merely, in my own words, acquaintances. If they really were just barely friends, how would one explain the regular conversations that might go on. When does a commitment to reply to messages from ‘Facebook friends’ become not just a commitment in its own right, but rather a consequence of real friendship?

I chat to people on Facebook, and I can generally say, almost everyone I converse with are proper friends, as in the age old definition. However, it pains me to find that while I value everyone around me, the converse is rarely true. Am I just another number within there contact list? Am I there simply to pass the time, and are we engaging in this conversation because we are friends, or because we serve a purpose – to kill time.

Of course, this begs the question – what is the definition of friends. Does true friendship always have a implicit emotional bond, one of responsibility when one party requires assistance? Do we always have to share secrets? I have people I occasionally chat to on Facebook, whom I consider friends. But they are there to serve a purpose – to make me happy, to fill a part in my life. Where do we draw the line? Why is it the case what if I use someone to kill time, one might consider this ‘using’ that person, whereas if that person brightens my day, that is a proper friend? Do one-way friends exist?

But all this is missing the point. I waste my hours over such trivial matters, not because I cannot define a friend. The realization that friends exist on a scale rather than a discrete ‘levels’ occurred to me long ago. What mattered to me, ultimately, what has taken so many of my blank stares out the window and filled even the most tranquil times with deep thought, is not where friendship becomes acquaintanceship, but the other end of the spectrum. A friend drifting away to become a mere acquaintance won’t make a difference. But when someone drifts in the other direction, finding that I value a person too much that the word ‘friend’ would not do them justice, that’s a whole different story. How do I tell if I am attracted to someone? While it exists on the same spectrum, that is a much realer and impactful question, and the one that I still spend many of my free hours thinking over.
